## Mazes for Programmers (Python)

[Mazes for Programmers](http://www.mazesforprogrammers.com) is an awesome book and you should definitely buy a copy. 

However, if you‚Äôre new to Python (like me) then it becomes a bit of challenge when all the examples in the book are written in Ruby. You spend a lot of time translating the code from one language you don‚Äôt know to another language that you‚Äôre trying to learn! üôá

So, here‚Äôs my simple, bare-bones Python version of the mazes code for anyone else in a similar situation. I‚Äôve tried to keep it as close to the book as possible so that it‚Äôs easy to go chapter by chapter without distractions. However, I would recommend that you try writing your own code first (that's the fun challenge!) and then only reference these examples if you get stuck.

A few notes: 

* I‚Äôve only included code for Parts 1 and 2 of the book (chapters 1-9). The other sections will follow as I continue working through the book‚Ä¶ üßë‚Äçüíª

* You will need [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) installed in order for the `to_png` function to work. Installation is quick and easy with [these instructions](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html).

* If you're looking for an explanation of how the different maze algorithms work, then buy yourself a copy of [Mazes for Programmers](http://www.mazesforprogrammers.com).

* If you find this code useful or inspiring, then feel free to [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/crux). ‚òïÔ∏è
