## Mazes for Programmers (Python)

[Mazes for Programmers](http://www.mazesforprogrammers.com) is an awesome book and you should definitely buy a copy. 

However, if you‚Äôre new to Python (like me) then it becomes a bit of challenge when all the examples in the book are written in Ruby. You spend a lot of time translating the code from one language you don‚Äôt know to another language that you‚Äôre trying to learn! üôá

So, here‚Äôs my simple, bare-bones Python version of the mazes code for anyone else in a similar situation. I‚Äôve tried to keep it as close to the book as possible so that it‚Äôs easy to go chapter by chapter without distractions. However, I would recommend that you try writing your own code first (that's the fun challenge!) and then only reference these examples if you get stuck.

A few notes: 

* I‚Äôve only included code for Part 1 of the book (chapters 1-5). The other sections will follow as I continue working through the book‚Ä¶ üßë‚Äçüíª

* You will need [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) installed in order for the `to_png` function to work. Installation is quick and easy with [these instructions](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html).

* If you‚Äôre looking for an all-singing, all-dancing Python version of the mazes code with bells and whistles, then you could try [this](https://github.com/Kartones/mazes-for-programmers-python-src) repository.
