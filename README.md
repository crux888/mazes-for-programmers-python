## Mazes for Programmers (Python)

[Mazes for Programmers](http://www.mazesforprogrammers.com) is an awesome book but all the code examples are in Ruby. If you‚Äôre new to Python (like me), it becomes a bit of a challenge trying to translate from one language you don‚Äôt know to a new language that you‚Äôre learning! üôá

So, here‚Äôs my simple, bare-bones Python mazes code for anyone else in a similar situation. I‚Äôve tried to keep it as close to the book as possible so that it‚Äôs easy to go chapter by chapter without distractions.

A few notes: 

* I‚Äôve only included code for Part 1 of the book (chapters 1-5). The other sections will follow as I continue working through the book‚Ä¶ üßë‚Äçüíª

* You will need [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) installed in order for the `to_png` function to work. Installation is quick and easy with [these instructions](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html).

* If you‚Äôre looking for some all-singing, all-dancing Python mazes code with bells and whistles, then you could try [this](https://github.com/Kartones/mazes-for-programmers-python-src) repository.
